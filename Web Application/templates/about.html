      <h1 class="about-h1">About Suicide Ideation Detection</h1>
      <p class="about-p">This website is dedicated to detecting suicidal ideation in texts using a deep learning model. The model has been trained on a large dataset of texts, enabling it to accurately identify language that indicates suicidal thoughts or tendencies. By detecting these signs early on, individuals can receive appropriate interventions and care, potentially preventing self-harm or suicide. The idea behind this project is to use technology to address a serious mental health issue. Suicide is a major public health concern, and early detection and intervention can play a critical role in preventing loss of life. By providing a tool that can quickly analyze texts for suicidal ideation, this website aims to contribute to suicide prevention efforts and improve mental health outcomes.</p>
